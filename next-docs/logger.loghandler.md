## LogHandler type

We allow users the ability to pass their own log handler. We will pass the type of log, the current log level, and any other arguments passed (i.e. the messages that the user wants to log) to this function.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type LogHandler = (loggerInstance: Logger, logType: LogLevel, ...args: unknown[]) => void;
```
