## component package

Firebase component framework.

 This is specifically tailored for Firebase JS SDK usage, if you are not a member of the Firebase team, please avoid using this package

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [Component](./component.component.md) | Component for service name T, e.g. <code>auth</code>, <code>auth-internal</code> |
|  [ComponentContainer](./component.componentcontainer.md) | ComponentContainer that provides Providers for service name T, e.g. <code>auth</code>, <code>auth-internal</code> |
|  [Provider](./component.provider.md) | Provider for instance for service name T, e.g. 'auth', 'auth-internal' NameServiceMapping\[T\] is an alias for the type of the instance |

## Enumerations

|  Enumeration | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ComponentType](./component.componenttype.md) | PUBLIC: A public component provides a set of public APIs to customers. A service namespace will be patched onto <code>firebase</code> namespace. Assume the component name is <code>test</code>, customers will be able to get the service by calling <code>firebase.test()</code> or <code>app.test()</code> where <code>app</code> is a <code>FirebaseApp</code> instance.<!-- -->PRIVATE: A private component provides a set of private APIs that are used internally by other Firebase SDKs. No serivce namespace is created in <code>firebase</code> namespace and customers have no way to get them. |
|  [InstantiationMode](./component.instantiationmode.md) |  |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [NameServiceMapping](./component.nameservicemapping.md) | This interface will be extended by Firebase SDKs to provide service name and service type mapping. It is used as a generic constraint to ensure type safety. |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [InstanceFactory](./component.instancefactory.md) | Factory to create an instance of type T, given a ComponentContainer. ComponentContainer is the IOC container that provides [Provider](./component.provider.md) for dependencies.<!-- -->NOTE: The container only provides [Provider](./component.provider.md) rather than the actual instances of dependencies. It is useful for lazily loaded dependencies and optional dependencies. |
|  [Name](./component.name.md) |  |
