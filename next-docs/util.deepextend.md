## deepExtend() function

Copy properties from source to target (recursively allows extension of Objects and Arrays). Scalar values in the target are over-written. If target is undefined, an object of the appropriate type will be created (and returned).

We recursively copy all child properties of plain Objects in the source- so that namespace- like dictionaries are merged.

Note that the target can be a function, in which case the properties in the source Object are copied onto it as static properties of the Function.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function deepExtend(target: unknown, source: unknown): unknown;
```

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  target | <code>unknown</code> |  |
|  source | <code>unknown</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>
