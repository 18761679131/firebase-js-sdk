## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [wrapCallback(callback)](./util.deferred.wrapcallback.md) |  | Our API internals are not promiseified and cannot because our callback APIs have subtle expectations around invoking promises inline, which Promises are forbidden to do. This method accepts an optional node-style callback and returns a node-style callback which will resolve or reject the Deferred's promise. |
