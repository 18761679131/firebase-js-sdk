## isAdmin variable

Attempts to peer into an auth token and determine if it's an admin auth token by looking at the claims portion.

Notes: - May return a false negative if there's no native base64 decoding support. - Doesn't check if the token is actually valid.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
isAdmin: (token: string) => boolean
```
